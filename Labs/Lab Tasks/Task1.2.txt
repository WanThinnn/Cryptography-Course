Task 1: Coding DES, AES using cryptopp library
A. Required:
+) Mode of operations:
  - Select mode from screen (using switch case)
  - Support modes:  ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, XTS, CCM, GCM.
+) separate encryption function from decryption function:
   Select from screen (using switch case or GUI)
+) inputs:
  - Secret key,  Initialization Vector IV, and nonce,..
  Select from screen (using switch case)
  Case 1: Secret key and IV are randomly chosen for each run time using random generator using CryptoPP::AutoSeededRandomPool;
  Case 2: Input Secret Key and IV from screen
  Case 3: Input Secret Key and IV from file (using file name)
 - Plaintext
    Case 1: Input from screen;
    Case 2: From files (using file name);
    - Support Vietnamse (using setmode, UTF-8)
 - Ciphertext
    Case 1: Input from screen;
    Case 2: From files (using file name);
    - Support Vietnamse (using setmode, UTF-8)
+) Ouputs (hex or base64 encode, binary):
   - display in screen;
   - write to file;

B. Report
Wrire your report in word file including:
  1. Report your hardware resources;
  2. Report computation performance on Windows and Linux;
    - Generate a set of diferent input sizes (at least 6 inputs in size KBs up to MBs)
    - Execute your code and check the computation time on average 10 000 running times;
    - Sumarize the results in a tables including: size of input, OS (Windows, Linux), encryption time and decryption time.
    - Do a comparison and your comments on both input size and OS;

Task 2: Coding AES using only C++ without other cryptographic external libraries;
Required:
+) Plaintext: 
    - Input from screen;
    - Support Vietnamese (using _setmode, UTF-8)
+) Mode of operations
     Using CBC mode
+) Secret key and Initialization Vector (IV)
     Input Secret Key and IV from screen

Note for task 1, task 2 inmplemetation in order
